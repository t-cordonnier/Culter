DESCRIPTION:
============

Culter is a set of Ruby classes to divide text into phrases (segments).
Currently it implements only a very simple algorithm.

USAGE:
======

This is a library to be used inside Ruby programs.
See bin/culter.rb for example of usage.

The script bin/culter.rb will act as an Unix text filter: 
STDIN will contain paragraphs, and STDOUT will contain them cut by phrases.
Takes two parameters: segmentation rules file (srx), and language.
Without parameter it will run the simple segmenter.
