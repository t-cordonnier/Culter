DESCRIPTION:
============

Culter is a set of Ruby classes to divide text into phrases (segments).
Currently it implements only a very simple algorithm.

USAGE:
======

This is a library to be used inside Ruby programs.
See bin/culter.rb for example of usage.

The script bin/culter.rb will act as an Unix text filter: 
STDIN will contain paragraphs, and STDOUT will contain them cut by phrases.
Takes two parameters: segmentation rules file (see samples and specs for supported formats), and language.
Without parameter it will run the simple segmenter.
Option -v gives more details also in STDOUT during segmentation (for debug)

The script bin/culter-conv.rb enables to convert between all supported file formats (SRX, CSCX, CSEX).
If you convert from CS[CE] to SRX, templates will be converted to their equivalent in SRX.
If you convert from CSE to lower format, specific features are simply removed.
